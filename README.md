# 🌊 YamunaGuard

### River Health & Citizen Action Platform

**Hackathon Project | Theme: Life Under Water (SDG 14)**

---

## 🧩 Problem Statement

River pollution monitoring today is **fragmented, delayed, and disconnected from real-world impact**.  
Although government systems and complaint portals exist, they primarily focus on **regulatory compliance**, not on **ecosystem health, public awareness, or community-driven action**.

As a result:

- Pollution hotspots remain undetected for long periods
- Citizens see pollution but cannot track outcomes
- Aquatic life suffers due to low oxygen, toxic discharge, and plastic waste
- Health risks to nearby communities are poorly communicated
- Reports often do not reach activists or NGOs who can act quickly

---

## 💡 Solution – YamunaGuard

**YamunaGuard** is a digital platform that transforms river pollution data into **visible, actionable intelligence** by connecting **citizens, aquatic ecosystems, and action networks**.

It ensures that pollution reports do not stop at dashboards, but lead to **real-world action**.
